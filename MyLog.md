Hi everyone! I am about to embark on a heroic adventure that will involve 100 days of coding. The rules are simple - code for an hour everyday and tweet/git about it with #100daysofcode. 

I plan to build epic android apps, polish my programming skills till they start shining like a diamond, and become an Android wizard with powers rivaling that of Gandalf and Albus Dumbledore. :)     

Some moments, I will feel like the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will feel like a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to improve my Android development skills('Or Die Tryin'). - Line by MightyJoe (can't come up with a better one)
 
Say cheers to **#100DaysofCode with _Neelabh Singh_**.

<h2>Day 1: Thursday January 3, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> I've been working on a baking app and today I tried integrating the card view inside recycler view to show a list of recipes. I also used the ButterKnife library for binding to make the code less verbose.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> I had to look at a tutorial to refresh my concepts regarding RecyclerView and CardView as I am a bit rusty currently. But I plan to take this project to a professional level and am looking to integrate both text and images in the CardView. Currently, I am getting an view inflater error in my CustomAdapter class which I need to figure out.</p>

<h2>Day 2: Friday January 4, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> I made further progress with the baking app. I resolved the layout inflation error which I mentioned on Day 1. I also ran the CardView inside RecyclerView for which I have attached a screenshot below.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> The layout inflation error was caused by using android:support.v7.widget.CardView instead of android.support.v7.widget.CardView. Silly me! Hard to believe that such a minor error took around 1 hour to figure out. Also, I realized I shouldn't use match_parent in CardView height else it taken up the entire space and doesn't display other items in the list. I am liking this habit of logging as it helps me in noting down the error so that I do not commit them again. If I commit them gain I just have to look at the solution recorded here. :)</p>

<h2>Day 3: Saturday January 5, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> After completing the frontend for the Main Recipes screen, I started work on the Recipe Instructions layout that would show up when a particular recipe is clicked. I plan to use RecyclerView for the same. Another important decision was to take the approach of first completing the front-end for all layouts and then work on the backend.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Had some confusion regarding the naming of layout files which are of two types. The main recyclerview and the supporting detailed layout for each element in recyclerview. Decided on using the name as combination of main-function-performed_main and _layout for the two files. Example, recipe_main and recipe_layout. Also, currently figuring out the best way to integrate onClick in recyclerview between main activity class and adapter class.</p>

<h2>Day 4: Monday January 7, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> The Recipe Instructions layout has been added using RecyclerView. An image has been added for the same.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> The incorporation of onClick element in RecyclerView is a bit tricky. Right now I have added the onClick element in the MyViewHolder constructor. However, to do that I had to make context filed static which is not the best practice and results in a memory leak. Need to find a better way to do it. Also, more formatting is needed to make the second screen look appealing.</p>

<h2>Day 5: Tuesday January 8, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Modified the static name/images in the Recipe list view to make it look more like a baking app. Added ingredients view to recipe steps layout.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Figuring out how to make the RecylerView of recipe steps look pretty by using ItemDecoration, Dividers and Spaces. Also, thinking on how to add a bulleted list of ingredients from a string array to the ingredients view in recipe steps layout.</p>

<h2>Day 6: Wednesday January 9, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Added lines between the steps in the RecyclerView. Though about how to add ingredients as bullets or listview.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Adding lines between items in recyclerview is quite simple uisng dividerdecoration. Took time as I realized I was adding it a wrong activity. Silly me!</p>

<h2>Day 7: Thursday January 10, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Added ingredients in the form of a bullet in the recipe steps layout. Also, explored ViewPager for creating swipeable receipe steps pages.
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Android Studio hangs in case the pending update is not made. Looks like an evil plan by these guys to make sure user keeps updating the platform asap! Also, I would be exploring exoplayer, tabview, and viewpager in the coming layout so quite excited. Note to myself, always code with 100% concentration. Debugging wastes a lot of time for simple activities. </p>

<h2>Day 8: Friday January 11, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Added exoplayer and description to recipe steps description view. However, exoplayer is not playing the mp4 video. 
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> I had fun learning about the capabilities of Exoplayer. Seems like the player of choice for running multiple video formats and allows controls over buffering, seeking, rendering, and others. Another option for video is to use Youtube player is the video is a Youtube video.</p>

<h2>Day 9: Saturday January 12, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Hit a roadblock today and couldn't run a video on Exoplayer 2.9.0 in spite of trying multiple ways for 2 hours. Seems like I will have to switch to a previous version.
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> As 2.9.0 is the latest version for Exoplayer not much sample code is available. It's not a phone issue as I am able to run sample code with previous version on my phone. Will switch to a previous version tomorrow in case I can't think of something else.</p>

<h2>Day 10: Monday January 14, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Finally, I was able to run the Exoplayer2 version 2.9.0. Realized it was a simple error that took almost 4 hours to correct.
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> The error was not giving internet permission and releasing player as soon as it was assigned. Providing internet permission in Android Manifest and releasing player in onStop solved the issue. And the Google Codelab on Exoplayer helped.</p>

<h2>Day 11: Tuesday January 15, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Today I got around to implementing the ViewPager to allow swiping between the recipe steps. There are still some details to be figured out. 
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> I am not yet showing the step name and sequence on the view pager for which I need to implement a tab layout. Also, the app crashes on swiping through multiple pages. Need to figure out the same.</p>

<h2>Day 12: Wednesday January 16, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Implemented the TabLayout with ViewPager to provide easy navigation for all recipe steps.  
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> TabLayout is part of the design library so need to include that in build.gradle file. The color of text in TabLayout can be adjusted using the xml file. xliff can be used for string format where number needs to be plugged. Still the viewpager crashed on swiping through 2 views. Need to investigate the reason.</p>

<h2>Day 13: Thursday January 17, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Fixed the ViewPager app crash happening due to a NullPointer Exception. Worked on implementing proper app navigation. 
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> TabLayout is displaying on top of Action Bar which needs to be corrected. The app's UI is taking a complete form.</p>

<h2>Day 14: Friday January 18, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Working on getting the App Bar in TabLayout. Right now TabLayout is showing on AppBar.
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Looks like such a simple change but taking time. Always account for extra time when committing for app development.</p>

<h2>Day 15: Saturday January 19, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Replaced the app bar with toolbar in all the views to get more control over it. Created a layout and used it as include.
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> If not for the challenge, I would have skipped the coding session today. Go 100 DaysOfCode!</p>

<h2>Day 16: Monday January 21, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Worked on putting the back button in the toolbar in tablayout but no luck so far!
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Not sure why I am unable to crack this. Looks so simple at a glance. More investigation needed</p>

<h2>Day 17: Tuesday January 22, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Identified that Toolbar works fine without ViewPager. And solved the backutton and app bar issue. Rushing for something, but will provide the image tomorrow.
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> Ah its frustrating! Coding sometimes tests your patience. Solved it - The issue was ViewPager was suppressing the original layout because I had activated some flags in the onResume in fragment. Systematically identifying the element that was creating the problem by commenting out other elements helped solve the issue. Use this technqiue in future.</p>

<h2>Day 18: Wednesday January 23, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> Worked on giving a fullscreen video experience on changing the mobile phone's orientation to landscape mode for the viewpager.
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> It has to be handled in two stages both in activity and fragment related to the viewpager. After this, the widget layout is left. THen my UI would be nearly complete. Then I would have to work on the data model and getting data from JSON.</p>
