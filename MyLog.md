Hi everyone! I am about to embark on a heroic adventure that will involve 100 days of coding. The rules are simple - code for an hour everyday and tweet/git about it with #100daysofcode. 

I plan to build epic android apps, polish my programming skills till they start shining like a diamond, and become an Android wizard with powers rivaling that of Gandalf and Albus Dumbledore. :)     

Some moments, I will feel like the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will feel like a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to improve my Android development skills('Or Die Tryin'). - Line by MightyJoe (can't come up with a better one)
 
Say cheers to **#100DaysofCode with _Neelabh Singh_**.

<h2>Day 1: Thursday January 3, 2019</h2>
<p><b>Today's Progress:</b> I've been working on a baking app and today I tried integrating the card view inside recycler view to show a list of recipes. I also used the ButterKnife library for binding to make the code less verbose.</p>
<p><b>Thoughts:</b> I had to look at a tutorial to refresh my concepts regarding RecyclerView and CardView as I am a bit rusty currently. But I plan to take this project to a professional level and am looking to integrate both text and images in the CardView. Currently, I am getting an view inflater error in my CustomAdapter class which I need to figure out.</p>
