Hi everyone! I am about to embark on a heroic adventure that will involve 100 days of coding. The rules are simple - code for an hour everyday and tweet/git about it with #100daysofcode. 

I plan to build epic android apps, polish my programming skills till they start shining like a diamond, and become an Android wizard with powers rivaling that of Gandalf and Albus Dumbledore. :)     

Some moments, I will feel like the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will feel like a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to improve my Android development skills('Or Die Tryin'). - Line by MightyJoe (can't come up with a better one)
 
Say cheers to **#100DaysofCode with _Neelabh Singh_**.
